Home backup power stations need serious capacity to run essential appliances during outages. A full-size fridge, some lights, phone chargers, and maybe a router can drain smaller units fast.

**What to look for:**
- 2000Wh+ capacity for meaningful runtime
- 2000W+ output to run refrigerators
- Expandable systems for whole-home backup
- Fast recharge for quick recovery between outages
- LiFePO4 battery for longevity
