Emergency power is about reliability. When a storm knocks out power, you need a unit that has been sitting in your closet for months to fire up and work perfectly.

**What to look for:**
- LiFePO4 battery (holds charge longer in storage, more stable)
- Easy operation (no complicated setup when stressed)
- Solar charging option (grid may be down for days)
- Enough capacity for essentials: phone charging, lights, medical devices
