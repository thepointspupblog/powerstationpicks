The best camping power stations balance capacity with portability. You want enough juice to charge phones, run lights, and power small devices without lugging around a 50lb brick.

**What to look for:**
- Weight under 30 lbs (ideally under 15 lbs for backpacking)
- 300-1000Wh capacity for weekend trips
- Solar charging capability
- Multiple USB ports
