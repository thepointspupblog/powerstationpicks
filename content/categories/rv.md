RV and van life demands more capacity than weekend camping. You need enough power to run a 12V fridge, charge laptops, power fans, and keep devices charged for extended periods.

**What to look for:**
- 1000Wh+ capacity (2000Wh+ for full-time van life)
- High continuous output (1500W+) for appliances
- Multiple charging options (solar, shore power, alternator)
- Expandable battery systems for longer trips
