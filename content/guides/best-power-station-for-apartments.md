## Balcony Solar Setup Guide

Here's how to set up solar in your apartment:

**Step 1: Check your balcony orientation**
- South-facing (in Northern Hemisphere) = best
- East/West = decent morning or afternoon sun
- North-facing = probably not worth it

**Step 2: Choose a portable solar panel**
- 100W panel: ~$100-150, generates 300-500Wh/day
- 200W panel: ~$200-300, generates 600-1000Wh/day
- Foldable panels store easily in a closet

**Step 3: Set up and angle the panel**
- Lean against balcony railing or use a stand
- Angle toward the sun (roughly your latitude)
- Move or adjust seasonally for best output

**Step 4: Connect to your power station**
- Run the cable inside (under door or through window)
- Power station charges during the day
- Use stored power in the evening

**Realistic expectations:**
- A 200W panel on a sunny balcony generates ~600-800Wh per day
- That's enough to offset 15-25% of an average apartment's usage
- Cloudy days = 20-40% of sunny day production
- You won't eliminate your electric bill, but you'll reduce it

## What Can You Actually Power?

Here's what apartment dwellers typically run:

| Device | Wattage | Runtime on 1000Wh |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| WiFi router | 15W | 66 hours |
| LED lights (5 bulbs) | 50W | 20 hours |
| Laptop | 50W | 20 hours |
| Phone charging | 20W | 50 hours |
| 32" TV | 40W | 25 hours |
| Small fan | 30W | 33 hours |
| Mini fridge | 50W avg | 20 hours |
| CPAP machine | 40W | 25 hours |
| Coffee maker | 1000W | 1 hour |
| Microwave | 1000W | 1 hour |

A 1000Wh power station easily handles daily essentials: router, lights, laptop, and phone charging for an entire day. High-draw appliances (coffee maker, microwave, hair dryer) drain it quickly but can be used in short bursts.

## Apartment-Friendly Features to Look For

**Quiet operation.** You'll have this indoors—loud fans are a dealbreaker. Look for units under 45 dB.

**Compact footprint.** Measure your storage space. Most 1000Wh units fit in a closet or under a desk.

**App control.** Monitor charge levels, solar input, and power usage from your phone.

**UPS function.** Some units (like the Anker SOLIX C1000) switch to battery instantly during outages—protects computers and keeps the internet on.

**Multiple charging options.** Wall outlet, solar, and car charging give you flexibility.

---

## Renter Considerations

**No permanent installation required.** These are portable devices. When you move, they come with you.

**No landlord permission needed.** You're not modifying anything. A solar panel leaning on your balcony is no different from a plant.

**Check your lease.** Some buildings prohibit items on balcony railings. A freestanding panel on the balcony floor usually works.

**HOA rules vary.** If you're in a condo, check the rules about visible equipment on balconies.
