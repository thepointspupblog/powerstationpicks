## Overlanding Fridge Power Math

**Step 1: Find your fridge's power consumption**
- Check the specs on your fridge (rated watts vs average)
- Most 12V overlanding fridges: 40-60W while running
- They cycle on/off, averaging 30-45W over time
- Dual-zone fridges use more (50-70W average)

**Step 2: Factor in ambient temperature**
- Hot weather = fridge runs more often
- 90°F+ days can increase consumption by 30-50%
- Shade your fridge to reduce power draw

**Step 3: Calculate your needs**

| Trip Length | Wh Needed (45W avg) | Recommended |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Weekend (2 nights) | 540-720Wh | 768Wh+ |
| 3-4 nights | 800-1200Wh | 1000Wh+ |
| Week | 1500-2000Wh | 2000Wh+ or solar |
| Extended (2+ weeks) | Solar required | 2000Wh + 200W panel |

---

## 12V vs AC: Which Output to Use?

**Use the 12V DC output when possible.**
- More efficient (no AC conversion loss)
- Runs cooler
- Many overlanding fridges are 12V native

**Use AC output when:**
- Your fridge only has an AC plug
- Running multiple devices simultaneously
- Fridge has AC-only features

**Efficiency difference:** 12V DC is roughly 10-15% more efficient than running through the AC inverter.

## Solar Integration for Indefinite Runtime

Pair your power station with solar panels for trips longer than a few days:

| Solar Panel | Daily Generation | Fridge Coverage |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 100W | 400-600Wh | ~50-70% of fridge needs |
| 200W | 800-1200Wh | 100%+ of fridge needs |
| 400W | 1600-2400Wh | Fridge + all other gear |

**The math:** A 45W average fridge uses ~1080Wh per day. A 200W panel on a sunny day generates ~800-1000Wh. That's close to break-even, with your power station covering cloudy days and overnight.

**Recommended setup for week+ trips:**
- 1000Wh+ power station
- 200W portable solar panel
- Result: Indefinite fridge runtime in sunny conditions

## Mounting and Setup Tips

**Secure your power station.** Overlanding involves rough roads. Strap it down or use a mounting system.

**Ventilate.** Power stations generate heat under load. Don't stuff them in enclosed spaces.

**Protect from dust.** Cover ports when not in use. Desert dust kills electronics.

**Pre-cool your fridge.** Plug in the night before at home. Cold fridges use less power to maintain temperature.

**Use a fridge thermometer.** 37°F is cold enough for food safety. Colder wastes power.
