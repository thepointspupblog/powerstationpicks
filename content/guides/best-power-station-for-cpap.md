## Quick Answer

Most CPAP machines use **30-60 watts per hour** (up to 100W with heated humidifier). For one night of sleep, you need around **250-500Wh**. For a weekend camping trip, get **500-1000Wh**.

## CPAP Power Math

Here's how to calculate your needs:

**Step 1: Find your CPAP's wattage**
- Check the label on your machine or manual
- ResMed AirSense 10: 30-60W
- Philips DreamStation: 35-65W
- With heated humidifier: add 30-50W
- With heated tube: add 15-25W

**Step 2: Calculate nightly usage**
- Wattage × hours of sleep = Wh needed
- Example: 40W × 8 hours = 320Wh per night

**Step 3: Add 20% buffer**
- Power stations lose efficiency during conversion
- 320Wh × 1.2 = 384Wh minimum for one night

**Quick reference:**

| CPAP Setup | Wattage | One Night | Weekend | Week |
|------------|---------|-----------|---------|------|
| CPAP only | 30-40W | 250-320Wh | 500-640Wh | 1750-2240Wh |
| With humidifier | 50-70W | 400-560Wh | 800-1120Wh | 2800-3920Wh |
| With humidifier + heated tube | 70-100W | 560-800Wh | 1120-1600Wh | 3920-5600Wh |

## Tips for Maximizing CPAP Runtime

**Turn off the humidifier.** This alone can cut power consumption by 30-50%. Use a moisture-wicking mask liner instead.

**Lower the pressure ramp.** The ramp-up period uses more power than steady operation.

**Use a DC adapter.** Many CPAP brands sell DC-to-DC adapters that bypass the inverter, improving efficiency by 10-20%.

**Charge with solar.** For trips longer than a few days, pair your power station with a solar panel for unlimited runtime.

## What About Dedicated CPAP Batteries?

Brands like ResMed and Philips sell purpose-built CPAP batteries. They work, but they're expensive ($200-400) and only power your CPAP—nothing else.

A portable power station at the same price gives you:
- More capacity
- Multiple devices (phone, laptop, lights)
- Longer lifespan
- Versatility for non-CPAP uses

The only advantage of dedicated CPAP batteries is size—they're smaller and lighter. If every ounce matters, consider them. Otherwise, a power station is the better investment.
